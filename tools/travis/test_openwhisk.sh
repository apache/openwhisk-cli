#  At this point, the Travis build should already have built the binaries and
#  the release.  If you're running manually, this command should get you to
#  the same place:
#
#    ./gradlew releaseBinaries
#
#  Also at this point, you should already have the openwhisk main repo. pulled down
#  from gradle in the parent directory, using a command such as:
#
#    git clone --depth 3 https://github.com/apache/openwhisk.git
#
#  To be clear, your directory structure will look something like...
#
#      $HOMEDIR
#       |- openwhisk
#       |- openwhisk-cli (This project)
#       |- openwhisk-utilities (For scancode)
#
#  The idea is to only build once and to be transparent about building in
#  the Travis script.  To that end, some of the other builds that had been
#  done in this script will be moved into Travis.yml.
#

#
#  Determine default directories, etc., so we're not beholden to Travis
#  when running tests of the script during the development cycle.
